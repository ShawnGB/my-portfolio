    "aboutMe": "My tech journey started with the founding of 'uskillity,' where I co-founded and managed the development of a product focused on making skills and knowledge more accessible. This early entrepreneurial experience ignited my passion for web and product development, propelling me to further expand my skills and knowledge.\n\nI embarked on my educational path at the National University of Ireland Maynooth, pursuing a BA in Business Marketing and Computer Science. This comprehensive program equipped me with a solid understanding of the intersection between business and technology, laying the foundation for my future endeavors.\n\nSince then, every experience I've gained has contributed to my growth as a freelance web and product developer. From my work as a full-stack web developer at freiheit.software GmbH & coKG, where I developed ReactJS and NodeJS-based applications and collaborated with customers to conceptualize features and enhance UX/UI, to my role as a technical project manager and Chief of Staff at Data4Life, where I improved company culture, facilitated retrospectives, and organized cross-functional teams for new projects.\n\nPrior to that, as a Junior Software Engineer and Product Owner at YPTOKEY, I had the opportunity to develop web, desktop, and iOS applications. In this role, I not only honed my technical skills but also contributed to shaping the blockchain core product and collaborated on designing a sustainable business model.\n\nThroughout my journey, I have gained expertise in a wide range of technologies and frameworks such as JavaScript, Java, Swift, Go, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Electron, SwiftUI, and Django. These skills, combined with my ability to leverage tools such as MS Office, InDesign, Photoshop, Sketch, Avid Pro Tools, and Logic Pro X, enable me to deliver high-quality digital products that meet clients' unique needs.\n\nBeyond my technical capabilities, I embrace a holistic approach to development. I believe in the power of collaboration, effective communication, and understanding clients' goals to deliver exceptional results. I continuously strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices, ensuring that the solutions I provide are innovative and future-proof.\n\nWhen I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me indulging in my passions. As a music enthusiast, hobby cook, passionate cyclist, and nature lover, I draw inspiration from diverse aspects of life. This well-rounded perspective enhances my creativity and fuels my drive to create impactful digital products.\n\nI am excited to embark on new projects and collaborations, leveraging my technical expertise and creative mindset to bring your ideas to life. Let's connect and discuss how we can collaborate to create remarkable web and product experiences that leave a lasting impression.\n\nReach out to me today, and together, let's shape the future through technology.",
